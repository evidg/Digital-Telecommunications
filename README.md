1. Huffman encoding: The purpose of this exercise is to extensively study the discrete source encoding method based on Huffman code by implementing a system for encoding/decoding a source of text characters. The performance of the system will be examined in terms of its ability to compress both "artificial" sources (randomly generated characters) and real sources (English word files) in the MATLAB computing environment.
   
2. PCM encoding: Implement a uniform and a non-uniform quantizer of N bits, i.e. 2N levels, as a MATLAB function.
  
3. M-PAM: Comparison of the performance of the M-PAM configuration for M = 2, 4, 8, and 16 respectively. This comparison will be based on Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) probability measurements performed on a homodyne bandpass system with an orthogonal pulse.
